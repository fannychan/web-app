Things I wished I'd known about during my time at university:

Version controlling:
Version controlling was used by the second year of my education. But, I really didnt know what I was doing, I was basically forced to
use it as a part of a project. Personally, I am a big fan of Github (and their stickers). To endure the jungle of git commands, I made sure
that I had the most basic knowledge - git init, git commit, git pull and git push. I had no clue that Git is a much more powerful tool than just this!
At the same time, I truly believed I would break the whole team's project at the fly if I left my comfort zone with git commands.
To explore git and get a closer look of what you can do with version controlling and how it can be a great part of your project, try githug.
